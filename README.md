# Finetuning FreeVC


FreeVC is an open source **Voice Conversion** model, released in 2022 ([Code](https://github.com/OlaWod/FreeVC) | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15418)). This Repository contains a [Jupyter Notebook](finetune_freevc.ipynb0) that takes you through all the steps of **finetuning** FreeVC for a particular speaker.

>**<summary>What is Voice Conversion?</summary>**
> 
> The goal of voice conversion is to make a recorded utterance of *speaker A* sound like it's being said by *speaker B*. To do so, we essentially want to remove the speaker-specific features of speaker A from the recording, and replace them with speaker B's features. This is different from similar technology such as voice cloning, which achieves a similar output, but on the basis of text-to-speech.
